############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

#make a loop that keeps the program going, here are the conditions:
#1. any player achieves a combo with a sum of 21 GAME OVER, winner with Blackjack!
#2. player has a hand with a sum over 21, GAME OVER, other player wins
#3. ELSE keep the loop going!!!!
